*The graph above shows months versus count of sussessful, failed and canceled theater campaigns*
From the graph above, we see an large increase in successful campaigns in the months of May, June and July. May with the most.
Also from the graph above, we don't see a significant change in the amount of failed campaigns throughout the months.

*the graph above shows % of successful, failed and canceled based on different goal amounts from theater-plays campaigns*
From the graph above we see the most successful percentage (72% to 75%) were from goal amounts set at less than 1000 to 4999. 
There is also a noticable increase in succesful percentage (66%) from goal amounts set at 35000 to 44999.
With that said, most campaigns with 5000 or more saw failure rates 50% or higher
